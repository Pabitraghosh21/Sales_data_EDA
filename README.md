# EDA & Data Modelling with Sales Data 

This dataset is a collection of data that provides information about the transactions that took place in a supermarket. This dataset typically includes information such as the date and time of the transaction, the products that were purchased, the price of each product, the total amount spent on the transaction, and other relevant details.

We will use this dataset to perform data analysis and gain insights into the behavior of the supermarket customers. For example, we might use this supermarket dataset to study the relationship between the day of the week and the total amount spent on transactions, or to analyze the factors that influence customer spending patterns. We might also use this dataset to identify trends and patterns in customer behavior, to optimize pricing and product placement, or to develop marketing and advertising strategies.

So basically this supermarket dataset can be a valuable tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of supermarket customers, and for making data-driven decisions that can improve the performance of a supermarket business.
